- The librarian will be able to check all borrowed books and their return date
borrowedBooks = db.books.find({borrowings: { $exist: true, returned: false} })
borrowedBooksAndLate = db.books.find({borrowings: { $exist: true, returned: false, expiredDate: {$ls: currentDate} } })

- The librarian may contact students who are late returning their books.
