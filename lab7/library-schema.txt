- The librarian will be able to check all borrowed books and their return date
borrowedBooks = db.books.find({borrowings: { $exist: true} })
borrowedBooksAndLate = db.books.find({borrowings: { $exist: true, expiredDate: {$ls: currentDate} } })

- The librarian may contact students who are late returning their books.
db.student.find( {studentid: {$in: [borrowedBooksAndLate] } } )

// Note:
We might need the history of borrowed book of student. That is why we have borrowedBooks in student collection.
