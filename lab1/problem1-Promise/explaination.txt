Explain how does this function (removeNum asynchronous) affect the event-loop?

The js code runs single thread. It means there is 1 thing executing at a time.
Browser has an event loop for every Browser tab. Event loop makes everything process isolated
and avoid infinite loop on a web page or heavy processing to block the browser.

The execution order for all the functions (iterations) in call stack:
- console.log('Start');
- Promise pending state
- console.log('Finish');  [wait for Promise returns fulfilled or rejected state but continue execute its work]
- Promise.resolved call back function

The event loop execute each iteration in above call stack until the call stack is empty.
