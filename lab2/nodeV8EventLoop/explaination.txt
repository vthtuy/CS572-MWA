1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
-> Supposes, event loop is picking up the function from I/O queue. 
Then new function (f) is registered into "check" queue by setImmediate.
Another function (f2) is  registered into "timer" queue by setTimeout.
Then the function (f) in "check" queue will be picked to push into V8 to execute.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
-> process.nextTick(f) will register function f into Priority queue which has the highest priority. The task in priority queue
will be picked first to push into V8 to execute.
Even though, at that time there remains tasks in other queues.
